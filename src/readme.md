## Source Code

This directory contains the **source code** (which is a central component of
this repository). I gathered source code when I experimented with different
languages and domains. A source code specific to a language is placed in
distinct subfolder, say `C-lang` for C language source code. Furthermore,
there's the following additional subfolders:
- `high-school-exam`: all related to my high school exam preparation (and the
  exam itself) that I took in 2022 in Computer Science (in Slovak, Informatika).
  > See [High School Exam](high-school-exam) for more information.
- `misc`: miscellaneous source code that doesn't fit into any other category.
