## High-School Exam

This subdirectory contains additional exercises, labs, and psets for my
high-school exam preparation (focused in Computer Science). The preparation
was carried out during the 2021-2022 academic year.

The labs (accompanied by a theoretical part) are further described in the
`theory.pdf` document (as well as inline comments in each source code file).

> TODO: describe each exercise in more detail (not from `exercises`)

### `exercises`

This directory contains stand-alone exercises that composed the examination
itself. See the attached [`readme.md`](./exercises/readme.md) for more details.
