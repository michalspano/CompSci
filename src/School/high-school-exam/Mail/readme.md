## `Mail` -- an exercise

This exercise is to read a `CSV` (or `xls`) file with compnay employees and
compute their email addresses given a **domain name** (e.g. Google) and a
**domain extensiomn** (e.g. `.com`).

I've developed three solutions to this problem each in a different programming
language (`C`, `Lua`, `Python`).

You can run `make` (given a `Makefile`) to execute all three solutions from a
single script.
