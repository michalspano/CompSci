### [Private][3] --- source code of all kinds :+1:

___

Here you find lots of source code written in several languages, just like `Lua`, `Rust`, `C#`, `C`, `Python`, etc.
It would be too hard to cathegorise all the files, so I prefer to store them in a specific directory.

### [Exercises][4] --- Collection of completed exercises about Computer Science
___

Sourced book - [Slovak](http://creatingwithpython.com/eknihy.html#mvp); [English](http://creatingwithpython.com/eknihy.html#spwp). For any __objections__, reach out to me via [email](mailto:michal.spano03@gmail.com).
